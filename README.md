## 🛠️ Feature Roadmap & Simulation Logic

### 1. **Financial Intelligence (Revenue Portal)**
* **The Feature:** Real-time earnings tracking with historical trend analysis.
* **Simulation:** The prototype utilizes a **Linear Gradient Area Chart** with dynamic scaling (Thousands vs. Lakhs), simulating live API feeds from global distributors (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.).
* **Business Value:** Provides complete transparency for artists regarding quarterly royalty distributions.

### 2. **Platform Engagement Split (Pie Analytics)**
* **The Feature:** Visual breakdown of where an artist's audience lives.
* **Simulation:** Uses a **Radial Distribution Chart** to show engagement across platforms like YouTube Music (45%), Spotify (30%), and others.



### 3. **Geo-Spatial Listener Mapping (India Heatmap)**
* **The Feature:** Regional density tracking to identify touring and marketing hotspots.
* **Simulation:** Employs a **Weighted Density Scale** focusing on West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Maharashtra hubs.

### 4. **Artist Resource Vault**
* **The Feature:** A secure document hub for official contracts, tax forms (GST/TDS), and schedules.
* **Simulation:** High-performance grid system with metadata tagging and simulated download triggers.

### 5. **Creator Workspace (Submission Engine)**
* **The Feature:** A structured pipeline for new track uploads and metadata verification.
* **Simulation:** State-managed forms with a **Live Review Cycle Tracker**, demonstrating the workflow from `Uploaded` → `Admin Review` → `Published`.
